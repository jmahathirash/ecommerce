# eCommerce Website
​
Hello! Welcome to my first eCommerce website! I made an ecommerce website as a project for a program that I'm in. I based the items around one of my favorite hobbies, making custom keybaords! On the site you will find custom keyboard specific items. Right now it only looks like an ecommerce site. There are future plans to hopefully make it functional
